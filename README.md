# devterm

whenever I'm writing code in the mode of 'edit, compile, run, repeat' I get
pretty tired of writing and rerunning slightly different commands over and over.

this is a terminal emulator that does that for you. you can add any number of
preset shell commands, and then run them easily. nothing complicated.

## usage

all you need is deno.

```bash
chmod +x serve.ts
./serve.ts
```

you can then navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser of choice.
